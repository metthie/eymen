    <h3>Using external tool</h3>
    <p>
      If you wish to temporarily try out a save, you can use the third party
      tool
      <a href="https://github.com/LEGOlord208/UndertaleSandbox" target="_blank"
        >UndertaleSandbox</a
      >. Please note that we are in <b>no way</b> related to them, or any of
      their actions. If you wish to learn the manual way of installing, carry on
      with the tutorial!
    </p>
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>
      First, you need to find your Undertale save folder. This is usually
      <code>C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/UNDERTALE</code>, but it might be
      different for you, who knows. It should contain at least a file called
      <code>undertale.ini</code> and a file called <code>file0</code>, unless
      you haven't saved your game yet, or the save was deleted.
    </p>
    <h3>Loading</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have found where your existing save data is, you can load it into
      Flowey's Time Machine to edit it. You don't have to load an existing save
      though you can select a preset instead at the top, or use the default
      preset which is set by default.
    </p>
    <h3>Editing</h3>
    <p>
      Just edit the various fields to your liking. Some fields can be hovered over
      with the mouse to get some information about the field.
    </p>
    <h3>Saving</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have edited the data to your liking, you can save it using the
      save button. Just overwrite your existing file0 and undertale.ini.
    </p>
    <h3>Undoing genocide erased world / selling your soul</h3>
    <p>
      If you erased your world, you should see a file called
      <code>system_information_962</code>. <br />If you sold your soul, you
      should also see a file called <code>system_information_963</code>.
      <br />Just delete these files using your file manager. If you are using
      the Steam version of the game, these files might be backed up and restored
      by the game on startup. In that case, you should delete the Steam data for
      UNDERTALE in addition to the system_ files. You can do this in multiple ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Modify the file permissions so that Steam cannot detect the file.<br />
        If you replace the file with a folder of the same name and restrict Steam's
        permissions to it, neither the game nor Steam will detect the file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Disconnect the game from Steam.<br />
        By renaming or deleting <code>steam_api.dll</code> in Undertale's game folder
        (NOT the save folder; it's where the game executable runs from, usually
        <code>C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Undertale</code>), the
        game will be disconnected from Steam. Deleting the system_ files will then work
        normally, but you won't be able to launch the game through Steam.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="Advanced_Mode">Advanced Mode</h3>
    <p>
      Flowey's Time Machine has an Advanced Mode for more detailed viewing and
      editing of file0. The vast majority of Undertale's save file is stored as
      a series of 512 "flags" containing extremely varied information, from your
      preferred pie flavor to whether you remembered Heats Flamesman's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flowey's Time Machine uses a consecutive list of these flags. Flags the game
      never normally accesses are grayed out, and flags the game never sets are
      highlighted in red. Every flag has a name and a mouseover description, often
      sourced from <a href="https://pcy.ulyssis.be/undertale/flags" target="_blank"
       >PoroCYon's data site</a
      > and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d5dt7A_jkTBhduVEGbWGtDbLEYMXCxSLUvqIqeXtYKw/" target="_blank"
       >The Undermodding Document</a
      >. Check those out for more information on most flags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flags can be edited and saved in much the same way as in the basic interface,
      using the provided dropdowns, checkboxes, and numerical fields. (1 usually
      represents an "active" flag, as the two are equivalent in computer terms.)
      Many of the most important flags to various routes are more easily editable
      from the basic interface. However, there are a few that may warrant special
      interest:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Genocide Route can entirely be controlled using the basic menu, but if
        you don't want to fill that out (nor use a preset to do it for you), flag
        <code>26</code> is a debugging flag that can jump you to any point in the
        route. Note, however: it will ignore further progress and lock you at
        whatever value the flag has.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Pacifist Route has several key points determined by flags. Flag <code>88</code>
        tracks your progress in Papyrus's date; flag <code>389</code> tracks dating
        Undyne; and flag <code>493</code> tracks Undyne's Letter, Alphys's date, and
        the True Lab. Finally, flag <code>7</code> (accessible in the basic menu)
        activates the post-Asriel epilogue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flags <code>300-324</code> contain the contents of your Dimensional Boxes.
        If you want to hack in more than eight items, use these.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flags <code>130-156</code> control a great many of the yellow credits for
        sparing enemies in the right way. If you want an all-yellow-credits run
        (or to analyze one), look here first.
      </li>
      <li>
        The status of your keychain is contained in flags. Asgore's keys are
        flags <code>452-454</code>; True Lab keys are flags <code>481-484</code>;
        and Sans's room keys are flag <code>497</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
